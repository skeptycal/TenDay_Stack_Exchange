    <reviewbody>Thanks for the September update, eager to see the next one. Did someone try importing this data into a StackExchange instance?

Fun to see how small the whole SE network is after all, only few GB compressed. Wikimedia projects dumps compress very well too, but they're still much bigger (while fitting a common hard disk anyway!).</reviewbody>
    <reviewtitle>Thanks and tests</reviewtitle>

    <reviewbody>At the top right corner of this page there is  a link to zip archive.  I've downloaded it twice (on different machines, in different countries). The file was always broken.

Torrent stucks on 70.8%.

Can anyone help to get this file?</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>Great data set. Thank you for sharing.

I see only March data. How can I get April data?
What about January and February?

Thanks,

    <reviewbody>The bit torrent link:
https://archive.org/download/stackexchange/stackexchange_archive.torrent

appears to link to an older version of the data dump. For stackoverflow the latest post I saw was from 2014.

However, if the .zip file 
https://archive.org/compress/stackexchange/formats=7Z&amp;file=/stackexchange.zip

appears to have data upto august 2015.</reviewbody>

I cannot download the torrent version either - can someone help make sense of the files?

    <reviewbody>The former limitation of 25 gigabytes for a torrent have been relaxed for this item, and the torrent is again working.

If you want to parse these large XML files, you need to use a streaming parser. I'm not surprised that an XML editor would have problems with a 40 gigabyte XML file! Most XML parsing software libraries have a streaming option.</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>Being discussed at https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/293127. A list of sites and their corresponding database filenames can be found there as well. 

Also note: Info about sites and their corresponding file names can be indirectly obtained via the /sites API query (http://api.stackexchange.com/docs/sites): For every site, the file name will match either the primary URL of that site *or* the URL of one of that site's aliases. There are no exceptions beyond SO (whose dump is uniquely split among multiple files). 

Sites that are very new relative to the archive date are not included in the dump.</reviewbody>

    <reviewbody>Hi :)
I can not use torrent (I am in Cuba)
The only option for us is to download file with wget.
However, when we try to download full stack exchange data dump we have a message:
"total size of requested files (44 GB) is too large for zip-on-the-fly"

Can I ask please to remove this limitation?</reviewbody>
